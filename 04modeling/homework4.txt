14.31 a. It is only in 1NF; in the functional dependency Book_type -> List_price, Book_type is not a candidate key,
		therefore it cannot be in BCNF or 4NF.
		b. 1st decomposition:
			Book(Book_title, Author_name)
			Book2(Book_title, Publisher, Book_type, List_price)
			Book3(Author_name, Author_affil)
			This eliminates a few of the dependiencies.
			
			2nd decomposition:
			Book(Book_title, Authorname)
			Book2(Book_title, Publisher, Book_type)
			Book2-2(Book_type, Listprice)
			Book3(Authorname, Author_affil)
			This eliminates the dependencies in Book2.

14.35 a. The candidate key(s) is {Book_Name, Author, Edition} or any superclass of it.
		b. For each book, one knows that there is a certain amount of authors there can be; in this instance, the only two
		authors of DB_fundamentals are Navathe and Elmasri, with respect to Edition and Copyright_Year, which are independent
		of Author.
