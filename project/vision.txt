For my database, I will make a database of all of the 2017 Grammy Award Nominees. I will have several tables,
including Award, Artist, Album, Label, Person, Song, and so on. I will need many intermediary tables,
as there are several people that are up for multiple nominations in multiple different roles. If there is not enough
data using this year alone, I could even extend the parameters to the past 5, 10, or x number of years in order
to get a sufficient amount of data.
	The users would be able to query the database in order to find all of the awards that a specific artist or album
was nominated for, or perhaps also to see all the nominees of each category. I will include the top three categories from 
the Grammys: Record of the Year, Album of the Year, and Best New Artist. 
	In addition, I will add the ability to let students vote for what they think should win each category for each year. 
This could be a fun interactive thing for students, and I could compare what the students vote for to what actually won.
