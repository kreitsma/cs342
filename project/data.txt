	I got the data for this database from www.grammy.com. However, that site only contains detailed data from this 
year's Grammys; fortunately, Wikipedia contains detailed records from Grammys in years past. I also have had to use Wikipedia 
to look up the real names of some producers.
	My chosen normal form is 4NF. I basically had to choose this by default; since this database contains many tables
that do not have many attributes (but are linked by many intermediary tables), there are no functional dependencies,
and there are no multivalued dependencies either. While this does make my access time a bit slower, it was necessary to create
all of these separate tables because of the many possibilities that multiple entities have to be linked to one another.
	
	My schema is in 4NF. 
	The non-trivial functional dependencies are:
		(All Primary Keys -> Attributes within their respective tables)
	The non-trivial candidate keys are:
		(All Primary Keys)
	Since the LHS of all the functional dependencies are candidate keys, my schema is in BCNF.

	The non-trivial multivalued dependencies are:
		(All Primary Keys ->> Attribute in repesective table | other attribute in respective table)
	The non-trivial candidate keys are:
		(All Primary Keys)
	Since the LHS of all the multivalued dependencies are candidate keys, my schema is in 4NF.
