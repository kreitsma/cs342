	I got the data for this database from www.grammy.com. However, that site only contains detailed data from this 
year's Grammys; fortunately, Wikipedia contains detailed records from Grammys in years past. I also have had to use Wikipedia 
to look up the real names of some producers.
	My chosen normal form is 4NF. I basically had to choose this by default; since this database contains many tables
that do not have many attributes (but are linked by many intermediary tables), there is only one functional dependency,
and there are no multivalued dependencies. While this does make my access time a bit slower, it was necessary to create
all of these separate tables because of the many possibilities that multiple entities have to be linked to one another.
	My schema is in 4NF. The functional dependencies are:
	Person.nickName -> Person.fName, Person.lName
	It is trivial to mention the primary key ID's of each table, as by their nature being primary keys they satisfy the LHS 
		specification for BCNF.
	Person.nickName is a candidate key; therefore, this relation is in BCNF.
	There are no multivalued dependencies. Therefore, this relation is in 4NF.
