	For my database, I will make a database of all of the 2017 Grammy Award Nominees. I will have several tables,
including Award, Artist, Album, Label, Producer, Performer, Engineer, and so on. I will need many intermediary tables,
as there are several people that are up for multiple nominations in multiple different roles. If there is not enough
data using this year alone, I could even extend the parameters to the past 5, 10, or x number of years in order
to get a sufficient amount of data.
	The users would be able to query the database in order to find all of the awards that a specific artist or album
was nominated for, or perhaps also to see all the nominees of each category. There could even be categories
and subcategories, e.g. an 'Albums' category containing 'Best Rock Album', 'Best Alternative Album', and so 
forth. That way, the user could see everything across all of the 'Albums' category.
