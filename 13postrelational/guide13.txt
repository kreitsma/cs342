a.
	Key motivation: impedance mismatch between the relational data structures and the in-memory data structures of the application--
	NoSQL allows developers to not have to convert in-memory structures to relational structures
b. 
	Aggregate: a collection of data that we interact with as a unit. Aggregates make it easier for the database to manage data storage over clusters, 
	since the unit of data now could reside on any machine and when retrieved from the database gets all the related data along with it.
c.
	Polyglot persistence is using multiple different storage technologies for persistence based on the way the data is being used in the application.
d.
	CAP: Consistency, Availability, Partition toleration--CAP theorem states that you can choose only two of the following.
e.
	Types: 
	Key-Value databases
	Document databases
	Column family stores
	Graph databases

a.
	A Major Key and Minor Key both specify a path to data. Records that share a major key are co-located to achieve data locality,
	so that lookups are fast. The Minor Key specifies a location within the locality of the Major Key.
