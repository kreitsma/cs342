a.
Parallel processes actually execute at the same time on different CPUs, but interleaving has one CPU switching back
and forth between the processes.
b.
The Lost Update problem is when two transactions that access the same database items have their operations interleaved
in a way that makes the value of some items incorrect. The Dirty Read problem is when a database item is updated but the
transaction fails, but the updated item is read before it is rolled back to its original value.
c.
Transaction: An executing program that forms a logical unit of database processing
Commit: When changes introduced by a transaction can be permanantly applied to the database
Rollback: Returns the database to a previous state
d.
Atomicity - performed in its entirety or not at all
Consistency Preservation - should take the database from one consistent state to the other
Isolation - should appear as being executed in isolation from other transactions
Durability - the changes from transactions must persist in the database
e.
A schedule is an ordering of the operations of the transactions

a.
A lock is a variable prevents multiple data items being accessed concurrently 
b.
Two phase locking has 2 phases:
	Expanding: locks are acquired and no locks are released
	Shrinking: locks are released and no locks are acquired

3.
a.
Rollback undoes the work done in the current transaction, while Savepoint identifies a point in the transaction to where 
the programmer can roll back. Commit ends the transaction and makes it permanent.
b.
The Lock Table statement explicitly locks entire tables, while For Update can lock specific rows.
