		Client Tier: consists of application clients that access a Java EE server and that are usually located on a different machine from the server.
		Web Tier: consists of components that handle the interaction between clients and the business tier. 
		Business Tier:  consists of components that provide the business logic for an application. 
		Enterprise Information Systems Tier:  consists of database servers, enterprise resource planning systems, and other legacy data sources, like mainframes.
		Java EE focuses on the web tier and business tier. I think Oracle would focus on the Enterprise Information systems tier as it contains the database servers.
	b.
		Java EE containers are the interface between the component and the lower-level functionality provided by the platform to support that component.
		There are Web containers, EJB containers, and Application Client containers.

		JDBC: lets you invoke SQL commands from Java programming language methods.
		JAXB:  provides a convenient way to bind an XML schema to a representation in Java language programs.
	b.

		Glassfish: Application server
